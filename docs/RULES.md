# DanctNIX Server/Channel Rules

## General channel rules:

**Follow Discord's Community Guidelines (https://discordapp.com/guidelines)**

Since our server is also on Discord, even if you aren't on there, you'll still have to obey it.

**Please be nice**

No harassment, hate speech, arguing over stupid things and trash talking, elitism over other people, technologies, phone brands, operating systems, window managers and etc. If you want to criticise things, try doing that constructively.

**No NSFW Content**

No NSFW/NSFL (gore)/other kinds of edgy content or any kind of link to such content, this includes things such as picture ID on imgur/hentai sites/4chan/etc.

**No spamming**

Do not spam, this includes posting copypastas, chain mail, bot usage, flooding, sending "walls of text" and etc.

**Please refrain from posting memes**

Please refrain from posting memes in general chat, they rather belong in #trash chat, although posting something related to current topic shouldn't be a problem.

**Do not annoy people**

Please do not ping people unless you want to ask them about it, this will result in a mute (or kick).

**Do not start drama**

All dramas **MUST** be kept outside this and connected chats, we will kindly ask you to move on somewhere else and take actions where appropriate.

**Do not get political**

All politics **MUST** be kept outside this and connected chats, there are other servers/channels for politics and we recommend you to discuss about that there.
